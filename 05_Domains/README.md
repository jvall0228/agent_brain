Ongoing areas of competence and responsibility. Unlike goals, domains don't have an end state — they represent sustained areas of focus.

## Template

Use [[09_Templates/template-domain]] for new domains.

## Examples

- Software engineering practices
- Knowledge management
- A specific technology stack
- A recurring type of task
