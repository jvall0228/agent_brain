# Inbox

Landing zone for incoming signals and unprocessed data.

Unlike the human shared-brain, the agent brain does NOT use Inbox as the default write target. The agent writes directly to the correct directory. This Inbox is for genuinely unclassified or externally-sourced content that needs processing.

## When to Use

- External data that hasn't been categorized yet
- Signals from integrations that need triage
- Content from other agents or systems
