# Inbox

Episode capture buffer and landing zone for unprocessed signals.

## Primary Role: Episode Capture

After completing non-trivial work, the agent distills the episode into a lightweight note here using `09_Templates/template-episode.md`. These are raw signals — what happened, what worked, what didn't — not analysis.

Episodes accumulate in the Inbox until the ingestion workflow processes them into structured memory (`03_Memory/`) and knowledge (`06_Knowledge/`).

## Two-Phase Loop

1. **Capture** (automatic, during work) — Write episode notes here
2. **Ingest** (deliberate, batch) — Process episodes into memory and knowledge

## Also Used For

- External data that hasn't been categorized yet
- Signals from integrations that need triage
- Content from other agents or systems
