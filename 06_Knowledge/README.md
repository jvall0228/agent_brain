# Knowledge

Semantic memory — accumulated, curated knowledge.

## Structure

| Directory | Purpose | Template |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| `patterns/` | Recognized patterns and heuristics | [[09_Templates/template-pattern]] |
| `facts/` | Verified factual knowledge | [[09_Templates/template-knowledge]] |
| `procedures/` | Step-by-step workflows | [[09_Templates/template-procedure]] |

## Promotion Path

Lessons from `03_Memory/lessons/` get promoted here when they're validated across multiple interactions. Patterns become procedures when they solidify into repeatable workflows.
